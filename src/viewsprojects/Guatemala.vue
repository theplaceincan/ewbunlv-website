              El Ceboll√≠n, Guatemala is an agricultural-based community made up of approximately 22 households. Without a proper schoolhouse, the children of these households had to walk two kilometers through an isolated road to reach the nearest school. The community solved this safety concern by building a one-room wooden schoolhouse, but this temporary structure did not meet the children's needs. The community partnered with EWB-UNLV to build a multi-room schoolhouse, which will provide a larger and more permanent learning space for the children and schoolteachers.  </p>

              To tackle this challenge, EWB-UNLV student members and professional mentors designed three plans for a new schoolhouse, and used a decision matrix to select a two schoolrooms, one office design. With the onset of COVID-19, the EWB-UNLV members also added a handwashing station to improve sanitation among the schoolchildren. The schoolhouse was constructed remotely, and is now fully completed. This schoolhouse provides a more stable space for the children to learn, and the increased space allows more children to attend school in the future. This space is also a gathering area for community activities and festivals.</p>

              In the future, the chapter will continue to work with the community to monitor the success of the schoolhouse and ensure its longevity. From this project, UNLV-EWB members learned valuable skills about project design, decision-making, report writing, and the culture of Guatemala.
